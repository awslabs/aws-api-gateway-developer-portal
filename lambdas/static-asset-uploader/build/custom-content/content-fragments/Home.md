### Welcome to The Commons Project’s Developer API Sandbox
        
This portal allows you to get API Keys for accessing our APIs so you can get started with the APIs and track your usage.

### Create an account

To use any of The Commons Project’s APIs, you must create a developer account. Create an account by sending a request to `api-request@commontrustnetwork.org`, or sign in using the button at the top right.

### Subscribe to APIs

Once you’ve created an account, you will be able to access your API Key. To activate it for a particular API, navigate to APIs and find the API you want. Click subscribe. Your API Key is now subscribed to the API and you can make calls to its methods.

Depending on the API configuration, subscribing to one API may subscribe you to several APIs. These APIs may have related functionality or share a pricing plan. Requests against any of them will be counted together in your usage.

### Getting Started with the APIs
We know that figuring out how to use APIs can be challenging. Use the “Try it out!” feature to get examples of the request and response shapes of our APIs. This makes an API call to the backend service using your API Key and provides a sample curl request with all necessary input parameters and the real response.

If you need your API Key for any reason, you can always find it on your dashboard after logging in.

### Monitor your usage

Typically, each API has a usage limit set for each API Key. As you scale up your usage of the APIs, you can monitor your usage towards the limits on your dashboard.
